#Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors. A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder. The simplest way to test if a one number is a factor of another number is to use the modulo operation.

The rules of raindrops are that if a given number:
    has 3 as a factor , add 'Pling' to the result.
